## 🌐 Deployment

You can deploy this app for free using [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud):

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Go to Streamlit Cloud and create a new app from your repo.
3. Set `app.py` as the main file.

---

## 📝 Example Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter your health details (age, sex, blood pressure, etc.).
3. Click "Predict Heart Disease Risk".
4. View your result and entered data.
